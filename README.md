# Movie_recommendation_system
## Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that I developed as part of my participation in the Winter in Data Science program organized by the IIT Bombay Analytics Club. The recommendation system is designed to provide movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie similarities.

## Why This Project
The Movie Recommendation System project was undertaken for several reasons:

*Learning Opportunity*: This project allowed me to apply and expand my knowledge of data science and machine learning concepts, particularly in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and recommendation systems.

*Real-World Application*: Recommendation systems are widely used in various industries, including entertainment and e-commerce. Understanding how to build one is a valuable skill in the data science field.

## What I Did
In this project, I accomplished the following tasks:

*Data Preprocessing*: I used the Pandas library to load and preprocess the movie dataset. This involved handling missing data, selecting relevant columns, and creating a combined textual feature for movie descriptions and genres.

*Text Vectorization*: I transformed the textual data into a numerical format using two common techniques in NLP: Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). I used the Scikit-Learn library to perform vectorization.

*Cosine Similarity*: I calculated the cosine similarity between movies based on their textual features. This similarity matrix allowed me to determine which movies are most similar to each other.

*Recommendation Function*: I implemented a recommendation function that takes a movie title as input and provides a list of recommended movies based on similarity scores.

## Importance
The Movie Recommendation System is important for several reasons:

*Enhancing User Experience*: Recommendation systems help users discover new content that aligns with their preferences, improving their overall experience.

*Personalization*: By analyzing user behavior and preferences, these systems provide personalized suggestions, increasing user engagement and satisfaction.

*Business Impact*: In industries like entertainment and e-commerce, recommendation systems can lead to higher sales and customer retention.

## What I Enjoyed
During this project, I particularly enjoyed:

*Hands-On Learning*: Building a recommendation system from scratch was a challenging but rewarding experience. It allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world problem.

*Problem Solving*: Overcoming data preprocessing challenges and optimizing the recommendation algorithm was intellectually stimulating.
